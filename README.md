# R Programming Roadmap

This repository provides a structured roadmap for learning and mastering the R programming language. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this roadmap will guide you through the essential topics and resources to become proficient in R.

The roadmap is divided into five stages, each focusing on a specific area of R programming.
Each stage includes a table with recommended resources such as online courses, books, tutorials, and packages. These resources will help you gain hands-on experience and further enhance your R programming skills.
